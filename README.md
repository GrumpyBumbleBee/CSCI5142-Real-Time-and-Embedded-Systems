  This project contains code and final project report on the built ball balancing machine using ATmega3208 AVR-BLE microcontroller, Ultrasonic Sensor,
  Servo Motor and PID Controller.
  
  The project focuses on designing and building a system to balance a ping-pong ball at a specific
  distance from an ultrasonic sensor. This system is crucial for understanding the principles of
  feedback control systems, particularly through the use of PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative)
  control. The key challenge addressed is balancing a small object (the ping-pong ball) on a beam
  while maintaining a precise distance from the sensor. By using an ultrasonic sensor to measure
  distance and a servo motor to adjust the beam's tilt, the system continuously forces the ball back to
  its target position.
  
  This project is related to embedded systems where hardware and software components interact
  closely. The embedded system includes microcontroller integration, sensor data acquisition, motor
  control, and real-time feedback using PID control algorithms.
